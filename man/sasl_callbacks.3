.SH NAME
sasl_callbacks \- How to work with SASL callbacks

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sasl/sasl.h>

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_callbacks
are used when the application needs some information from the
application. Common reasons are getting for getting usernames and
passwords. A client MUST specify what callbacks they support in the
sasl_client/server_init() or sasl_client/server_new() calls. If an
authentication mechanism needs a callback that the application does
not state it supports it cannot be used. 

If a callback has an
.B id
parameter that should be checked to make sure you are giving the appropriate value.

If an application is using the client side of the library functions to handle the callbacks are not necessary. Instead the application may deal with callbacks via SASL_INTERACT's. See sasl_client_start/step() for more information.

The list of callbacks follows:

 sasl_getopt_t     client/server: Get an option value
 sasl_log_t        client/server: Log message handler
 sasl_getpath_t    client/server: Get path to search for mechanisms
 sasl_verifyfile_t client/server: Verify files for use by SASL
 sasl_canon_user_t client/server: Username canonicalization function.
 sasl_getsimple_t  client: Get user/language list
 sasl_getsecret_t  client: Get authentication secret
 sasl_chalprompt_t client: Display challenge and prompt for response
 sasl_getrealm_t   client: Get the realm for authentication
 sasl_authorize_t  server: Authorize policy callback
 sasl_server_userdb_checkpass_t server: verify plaintext password
 sasl_server_userdb_setpass_t   server: set plaintext password

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

SASL callback functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for a complete list. SASL_OK typically indicates success.
