.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_listmech()
returns a string listing the SASL names of all the mechanisms available to the specified user. This is typically given to the client through a capability command or initial server response. Client applications need this list so that they know what mechanisms the server supports.

.I conn
the SASL context for this connection
.I user
(optional) restricts the mechanism list to only those available to the user.
.I prefix
appended to beginning of result
.I sep
appended between mechanisms
.I suffix
appended to end of result
.I result
NULL terminated result string (allocated/freed by library)
.I plen
length of result filled in by library. May be NULL
.I pcount
Number of mechanisms available (filled in by library). May be NULL

.nf
Example:

sasl_listmech(conn,NULL,"(",",",")",&mechlist,NULL,NULL);

may give the string 
.BI (ANONYMOUS,KERBEROS_V4,DIGEST-MD5)
as a result
