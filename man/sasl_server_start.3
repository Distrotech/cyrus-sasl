.SH DESCRIPTION

.B sasl_server_start()
begins the authentication with the mechanism specified with mech. This
fails if the mechanism is not supported. SASL_OK is returned if the
authentication is complete and the user is
authenticated. SASL_CONTINUE is returned if one or more steps are
still required in the authentication. All other return values indicate
failure.

.PP
.I conn
is the SASL context for this connection
.PP
.I mech
is the mechanism name that the client requested
.PP
.I clientin
is the client initial response, NULL if empty
.PP
.I clientinlen
is the length of initial response
.PP
.I serverout
is created by the plugin library. It is the initial server response to send to the client. This is allocated/freed by the library and it is the job of the client to send it over the network to the server. Also protocal specific encoding (such as base64 encoding) must needs to be done by the server.
.PP
.I serveroutlen
is set to the length of initial server challenge
