New in 2.0.0-ALPHA
------------------
* THIS IS AN ALPHA-QUALITY RELEASE THAT IS ONLY INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS
  WHOSE APPLICATIONS MAKE USE OF THE CYRUS SASL LIBRARY.
* Implements the SASLv2 API.
  Improvements include:
  - Memory management is now sane (whoever allocates the memory is responsible
    for freeing it)
  - Auxilliary Property plugin support (ability to interface with directory
    services as part of authentication)
  - Username Canonification plugin Support
  - Improved error reporting (not fully implemented in this release)
  - Database support has been simplified.  We now maintain only a single
    store of plaintext passwords that is shared by all supplied plugins
    (using the auxilliary property interface).
  The new API is more fully documented in the header files sasl.h, saslplug.h
  saslutil.h, and prop.h.
* There is still a good amount of work to be done, and as this code is alpha
  quality, it probabally has bugs.  Please either use our bugzilla at
  http://bugzilla.andrew.cmu.edu, or email cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu with
  questions, comments, or bug reports.
